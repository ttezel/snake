##`Snake`

Given a 2D maze, `snake` solves the maze for a given `start` and `end` point in the maze.

Each position in the maze can be either empty or blocked (marked by a `0` or `1` respectively).

`snake` can only move up, down, left or right, but not diagonally. It cannot enter
blocked positions.

##Install

```
  npm install snake
```

##Usage

```javascript
var Snake = require('snake')

var maze = [

##`Snake` API

### .solve( `options` )

Find a route from `start` to `end`, using the `heuristic` to guide the search. Returns an object.

####options

`options` is an object with the following keys:

* `maze`:     a 2D Array in which each value is `0` or `1`
* `start`:    [x,y] coordinates
* `end`:      [x,y] coordinates
* `heuristic`: search heuristic to use when exploring the maze

Note: for the coordinates, [0,0] is bottom left point in `maze` (cartesian coordinate system)

####`heuristic`

Supported search heuristics are:
  * `breadthFirst` : Uses a breadth-first search.
  * `depthFirst` : Uses a depth-first search.
  * `linear` : Explores by minimizing the cartesian distance from the `end` point.
  * `manhattan` : Explores by minimizing the manhattan distance from the `end` point.

####output

`Snake.solve()` returns an object that looks like this:

```javascript
{ msg: 'found exit',
  status: 1,        //  1 = success, 0 = impossible to solve for given start & end points
  elapsed: 1,       //  total time required to run the search (milliseconds)
  numVisited: 268,  //  # of points searched in the maze to find a route
  route:          
   [ [ '2', '11' ],
     [ '2', '12' ],
     [ '2', '13' ],
     [ '2', '14' ],
     [ '2', '15' ],
     [ '2', '16' ],
     [ '3', '16' ],
     [ '4', '16' ],
     [ '5', '16' ],
     [ '6', '16' ],
     [ '7', '16' ],
     [ '7', '17' ],
     [ '7', '18' ],
     [ '7', '19' ],
     [ '6', '19' ],
     [ '5', '19' ],
     [ '4', '19' ],
     [ '3', '19' ],
     [ '2', '19' ],
     [ '2', '20' ],
     [ '2', '21' ] ],
  cost: 21 }        //  the cost for the discovered route (assumes all movements have cost = `1`)
```

###.paint(`result`)

Draws a pretty maze in your terminal (similar to [this](https://github.com/ttezel/snake#snake)). Pass in the `result` object
that you get back from `.solve()`, and it'll render the snake's path in your terminal.
