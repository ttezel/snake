##`Snake`

Given a 2D maze, `snake` solves the maze for a given `start` and `end` point in the maze.

Each position in the maze can be either empty or blocked (marked by a `0` or `1` respectively).

`snake` can only move up, down, left or right, but not diagonally. It cannot enter
blocked positions.

##Usage

```javascript
var Snake = require('./snake')

var maze = [
  [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

##`Snake` API

### .breadthFirst( `options` )

Find a path from `start` to `end`, using a breadth-first search.

### .depthFirst( `options` )

Find a path from `start` to `end`, using a depth-first search.

### .alternate( `options` )

Find a path from `start` to `end`, using an alternate search heuristic.

###options

`options` is an object with the following keys:

* `maze`:     a 2D Array in which each value is `0` or `1`
* `start`:    [x,y] coordinates
* `end`:      [x,y] coordinates

Note: for the coordinates, [0,0] is bottom left point in `maze` (cartesian coordinate system)
